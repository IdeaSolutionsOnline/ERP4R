ERP + Managing for Results

Development Platform that makes the construction of customized business solutions easy and affordable.


This platform is developed in python, one of the top programing languages of our days and can be defined as a RAPID business applications development platform.

Works in Linux but being python can be multiplatform, uses PostgreSQL as preferential database engine but can work with other DB engines. For security, price and performance reasons we advise to keep the original choice.

Over 20 years of experience working with hundreds of management software’s are resumed in this solution that aims to achieve one important goal! be a tool that allows a really fast development of business applications and a very flexible and adaptable platform that allows the manager to adapt the software to the business processes and not the other way around. It is designed to adapt the software and develop new functionalities in a small part of the time that in other development platforms and so with a small portion of the budget.

Is open source and can be used and improved by anybody! the development of modules is really fast allowing to make the analysis of the functionalities directly on the platform by prototyping, so the client can see the screens really fast and participate actively in the development process. The development is focused in the business rules because ERP+ automatizes the data model and the interface development parts of the software.

By design is prepared to be distributed, and the choice of technologies allows to save a lot of money in infrastructure’s because the hardware demand is much less (really much less, one basic VPS hosts 10 or more solutions with many users). being distributed we can use local servers that communicate between them and synchronize the data but allows to operate even in the eventuality of a communication problem between the servers.

The server with the problem will synchronize the information after the communication is restored. It allows to
partition the data too, so each local server may have only the information that concerns to the local users and a central server may have all the information, this is very good not only for performance and cost saving but also for security of the data.

Is focused in simplicity, robustness and flexibility. This three pillars are the base of the philosophy of ERP+.
It creates automatically the interface but allows the user to create customized interfaces to develop sites and portals if necessary.

Because the development on the platform is really fast (20% of the time of development in a normal development platform) we can produce new functionalities with a small portion of the usual budget. As a start facilitator, the platform already has a lot of modules ready to use and even some, ready to use applications that put together these modules for a real live use.

The development design allows to use some or all of the main modules of the application adapting them to institution needs by heritage and adaptation. This allows, for instance, a government to distribute a payments solution to every institution that is the same solution and synchronizes with the central servers but still is different and customized for the needs of every institution.

ERP4R is modularized not by delivery but by object so a report or an invoice or a treasury management sheet are modules. The main advantage of this approach is the facility to reuse code and create customized solutions that communicate and share information even being separated by role, institution or other matter.
Some of the relevant solutions already developed in the solution are:

Public Accounting system
Public Depth Management system
Commercial Management
Presential attendance management system (this one supports electronic automatism for the ticket dispensers)
Human resources
Assets Management
Water distribution management system
Support Management
Public procurement Portal
National system of Public Investment
Bar and Restaurant management
Public Revenues Inspector support system (controls audicts, helps risc based selection, compares data and helps identify not conformity tax declarations)
Wood transformation and distribution management system
Police station management
Health center management
Etc.

The shared modules developed until now and part of the platform are at the moment around 190. As more relevant examples that I can refer:
Chart of accounts, accounting movements, fiscal years, accounting periods, treasury movements, stock movements, invoices, cash transfers, banc reconciliation, human resources tax declarations, warehouses, Assets, public bits, contracts, distribution, stock reconciliations, documents, products, processes, proposals, projects, tasks, receipts, alerts, tickets, entities, etc.

If you ask me what is the main reason to choose this solution, I can tell you that is the only solution I know that allows to adapt really fast and at small cost and have a really easy maintenance, reducing the costs and the customer dependence. Today's challenge’s requires this kind of flexibility that other solutions do not provide.

There are other good solutions in the market and some are really impressive in marketing and image but at the end they all are more expensive (considering total cost of ownership) and less flexible.

This platform was tested to work with millions of records with success, uses in is core several technics to improve performance and security so that the programmer does not have to worry about that, basically the programmer just has to understand the business specialist and reproduce that knowledge in the code, focusing in the business rules. Don't have to be a database expert or an interface expert or even a security expert because the platform does that job for the developer.
